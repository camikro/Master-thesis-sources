  abstract = {Taking an original, imaginative approach to the subject, Stephen Elliott's book is one of the first to bridge the gap between solid state physics and chemistry. Considerable thought has gone into the structure and content of this book, with the first four chapters covering the properties of atoms in solids and the remaining four concentrating on the behaviour of electrons in materials. Fundamental principles are covered together with the very latest developments, such as combinatorial library synthesis, mesoporous materials, fullerenes and nanotubes, optical localization and the experimental observation of fractional electronic charge. Clearly written and richly illustrated, The Physics and Chemistry of Solids will be of great interest to Physicists, Chemists, Material Scientists and Engineers.},

Ferroelectrics hold great promise as the next generation of scaffolds for tissue repair since they feature tunable surface electrical charges, piezoelectricity, and sensing capabilities. We investigate the topography, wettability, chemical stability, and cytotoxicity in salient ferroelectric systems such as (1-x) (Na1/2Bi1/2)TiO3--xBaTiO3, (1-x)Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3-x(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3, and Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 to test their suitability as biomaterials. The lead-free ferroelectrics promote in vitro cell viability and proliferation to a considerably high extent. 0.94 mol \% (Na1/2Bi1/2)TiO3--0.06 mol\% BaTiO3 showed the greatest potential leading to a cell viability of (149 \textpm{} 30)\% and DNA synthesis of (299 \textpm{} 85)\% in comparison to the reference. Lead leaching from Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 negatively affected the cultured cells. Wettability and chemical stability are key factors that determine the cytotoxicity of ferroelectrics. These variables have to be considered in the design of novel electroactive scaffolds based on ferroelectric ceramics.},

In this work, a comprehensive study has been carried out to investigate the influence of surface charge and polarity on in vitro bone cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation on electrically polarized HAp-coated Ti. Uniform and crack free sol--gel derived HAp coatings of 20\textpm 1.38{$\mu$}m thickness were polarized by application of an external d.c. field of 2.0kVcm-1 at 400{$^\circ$}C for 1h. In vitro bioactivity of polarized HAp coatings was evaluated by soaking in simulated body fluid, and bone cell--material interactions were studied by culturing with human fetal osteoblast cells (hFOB) for a maximum period of 11days. Scanning electron microscopic observation showed that accelerated mineralization on negatively charged surfaces favored rapid cell attachment and faster tissue ingrowth over non-polarized HAp coating surfaces, while positive charge on HAp coating surfaces restricted apatite nucleation with limited cellular response. Immunochemistry and confocal microscopy confirmed that the cell adhesion and early stage differentiation were more pronounced on negatively charged coating surfaces as hFOB cells expressed higher vinculin and alkaline phosphatase proteins on negatively charged surface compared to cells grown on all other surfaces. Our results in this study are process independent and potentially applicable to any other commercially available coating techniques.},

  abstract = {Bone tissue is continuously remodeled through the concerted actions of bone cells, which include bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts, whereas osteocytes act as mechanosensors and orchestrators of the bone remodeling process. This process is under the control of local (e.g., growth factors and cytokines) and systemic (e.g., calcitonin and estrogens) factors that all together contribute for bone homeostasis. An imbalance between bone resorption and formation can result in bone diseases including osteoporosis. Recently, it has been recognized that, during bone remodeling, there are an intricate communication among bone cells. For instance, the coupling from bone resorption to bone formation is achieved by interaction between osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Moreover, osteocytes produce factors that influence osteoblast and osteoclast activities, whereas osteocyte apoptosis is followed by osteoclastic bone resorption. The increasing knowledge about the structure and functions of bone cells contributed to a better understanding of bone biology. It has been suggested that there is a complex communication between bone cells and other organs, indicating the dynamic nature of bone tissue. In this review, we discuss the current data about the structure and functions of bone cells and the factors that influence bone remodeling.},

The formation of bone-like apatite layer on SPS consolidated HA compacts were investigated by soaking the HA compacts in simulated body fluid (SBF) for various periods (maximum of 28 days). The structural changes in HA post-SBF were analyzed with scanning electron microscopy, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that a layer consisting microcrystalline carbonate-containing hydroxyapatite was formed on the surface of HA compacts after soaking for 24h. The formation mechanism of apatite on the surface of HA compacts after soaking in SBF was attributed to the ion exchange between HA compacts and the SBF solution. The increase in ionic concentration of calcium and phosphorus as well as the increase in pH after SBF immersion resulted in an increase in ionic activity product of apatite in the solution, and provided a specific surface with a low interface energy that is conducive to the nucleation of apatite on the surface of HA compacts.},

Many of these implantables rely on piezoceramics for sensing, communication, energy autonomy, and biological stimulation, but the piezoceramics with the strongest piezoelectric coefficients are almost exclusively lead-based. In this article, we evaluate the electromechanical and biological characteristics of a lead-free alternative, 0.94Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-0.06BaTiO3 (BNT-6BT), manufactured via two synthesis routes: the conventional solid-state method (PIC700) and tape casting (TC-BNT-6BT). The BNT-6BT materials exhibited soft piezoelectric properties, with d33 piezoelectric coefficients that were inferior to commonly used PZT (PIC700: 116 pC/N; TC-BNT-6BT: 121 pC/N; PZT-5A: 400 pC/N). The material may be viable as a lead-free substitute for soft PZT where moderate performance losses up to 10 dB are tolerable, such as pressure sensing and pulse-echo measurement. No short-term harmful biological effects of BNT-6BT were detected and the material was conducive to the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 murine preosteoblasts. BNT-6BT could therefore be a viable material for electroactive implants and implantable electronics without the need for hermetic sealing.},

However, to date, there are rather limited long-term implantable materials owning to in situ molding incapability of metallics and poor mechanical property of nonmetallics. Here, Bi-based low melting point alloy, with unique properties of injectability, solid-liquid phase transition, mechanical capability, and biocompatibility, present obvious long-lasting bone affinity as the excellent artificial bone-substitute. It is particularly necessary to point out that the targeted injected Bi alloy remains in its original position for up to 210 days without moving, as well as, displays good osseointegration ability to resolve repeated revision trauma caused by losing bone repair material. Additionally, with outstanding electrical and thermal conductivity, an unconventional way using Bi alloy to realize very beneficial hyperthermia analgesia via non-invasive wireless energy delivery is first proposed, which avoids adverse effects on bone remodeling inflicted by traditional drugs. The significantly decreased expression of pain sensitizing factor, such as, interleukin-6, neuropeptide substance, and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 reveals the potential mechanism of hyperthermia analgesia. The present findings suggest the combination therapy of Bi alloy in bone repair and analgesia, which owns far-reaching clinical application value.},

Osteoblasts synthesize and~deposit organic bone matrix (osteoid) proteins that will~mineralize in both developing skeletons and during the process of~bone remodeling that occurs continuously throughout an individual's life.~ Bone is approximately~10\% water, 30\% organic, and 60\% inorganic. The organic component is approximately 85 to 90\%~collagen (primarily type 1 -resisting tensile forces), proteoglycans (resisting compressive forces), non-collagenous proteins (osteocalcin and osteonectin) and glycoproteins (osteopontin).~The inorganic component, or mineralized matrix, is composed of hydroxyapatite crystals [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2] that provides protection and support while serving as the body's repository for calcium and phosphate.~Osteoblasts also indirectly regulate osteoclast formation and bone remodeling by cell-cell contact, paracrine signaling, and cell-bone matrix interaction. Osteoblasts~derive from two embryonic populations of mesenchymal stromal~cells (or mesenchymal stem cells, MSCs).~MSCs~originating from the neural ectoderm can directly differentiate into osteoprogenitor cells~that will become osteoblasts and form bone through intramembranous ossification (i.e., squamous bones of the calvaria and clavicle). MSCs originating from the paraxial mesoderm differentiate into axial skeleton osteoblasts, while the MSCs of the lateral plate mesoderm form osteoblasts of the appendicular skeleton. The axial and appendicular skeleton develop by endochondral ossification, with these osteoblasts deriving~from intermediate perichondral cells or hypertrophic chondrocytes.~Both the indirect and direct~processes converge at osteoprogenitor cells (or preosteoblasts).~Osteoblasts are induced from the osteoprogenitor cells by numerous~signals.

BNTBT-100xBSN ceramics are pseudo-cubic perovskite structure, with dense surface morphology. Doping BSN can effectively reduce the dielectric loss of ceramics and increase the relaxation properties to a certain extent. The randomly distributed ferroelectric phase was replaced by polar nano regions, thereby improving the electro-strain and energy storage performance of the system. The largest electro-strain and the corresponding normalized strain (d33*) reach~\textasciitilde ~0.43 \% and 633 pm/V respectively in the BNTBT-1BSN ceramic. The largest effective energy storage density reaching \textasciitilde{} 1.28~J/cm3 was tested in BNTBT-2BSN. BNTBT-100xBSN ceramics provide a feasible idea for the systematic research of lead-free ferroelectrics and improvements in electro-strain and energy storage applications.},

  abstract = {Piezoelectric materials are able to generate charges with redox capabilities under the action of external mechanical stress, thereby achieving the conversion from mechanical energy to electrical energy and being widely utilized in biomedical research. Due to their good biocompatibility, high energy conversion efficiency, high biological activity, and stability, they show a bright prospect in future medical applications. Under the action of external force, piezoelectric materials are able to release electrons and holes, intervene in the living body to promote the occurrence of certain reactions, or provide a continuous power source for human devices to achieve medical purposes, such as tissue repair, drug release, cancer treatment, and biosensing. Piezoelectric biomedicine technology provides a more efficient and convenient means, improving the quality of life of patients. In order to promote the innovation of new medical technologies, especially the development of treatment methods, this paper systematically summarizes the latest research trends and the phased progress achieved in recent years of piezoelectric materials in the biomedical field. Firstly, the preparation techniques and basic classifications of piezoelectric materials are introduced. Different properties and application techniques of piezoelectric biomaterials are reviewed, and a brief summary of their multiple comprehensive applications in clinical practice is made. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by piezoelectric materials in biomedicine and their future development directions, providing valuable insights and suggestions for subsequent research work.},

On the basis of these findings, a bonelike apatite layer can be formed even on metals such as silicon, titanium and its alloys, tantalum, and organic polymers such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), polyether sulfone and polyethylene in a simulated body fluid with ion concentrations nearly equal to those of human blood plasma, when their surfaces are a little modified.},

The surface roughness of the composite started to increase after the initial 8h because of both the degradation of the polymer matrix and the nucleation of calcium phosphate. After 24h of immersion the surface of the composite was fully covered with calcium phosphate nuclei with diameters around 126nm. As the immersion time increased, the nuclei increased both in number and size, and coalesced leading to the formation of a dense and uniform calcium phosphate layer on the surface of the composite only after 126h of SBF immersion. The results of in situ AFM observation agreed with those of standard in vitro bioactivity tests in combination with scanning electron microscopy observations. Thin-film X-ray diffraction demonstrated that the ratio of apatite to the polymer matrix was higher within the surface layer (40{$\mu$}m deep from the surface) than that in the bulk after the immersion for 7 days. The water-uptake capability of the polymer contributes to the nucleation and growth of the calcium phosphate layer. These results suggest the great potential of the composite for a range of temporary applications in which bone-bonding ability is a desired property.},

X-ray diffraction results confirmed the formation of BNT--xBT solid solutions and a structural transition from rhombohedral to tetragonal symmetry. Frequency-dependent dielectric measurements showed a notable increase in the relative permittivity (1750) of doped BNT, which is~{$>~$}2-fold higher than that of pristine BNT, owing to the diminished size of ferroelectric domains, confirmed via piezoresponse force microscopy analysis. Temperature-dependent analysis of permittivity revealed a broad peak and diffuse phase transition after BT incorporation, indicating the presence of small ferroelectric domains. Polarization--electric field loops exhibited a reduced coercive field from {$\sim$}60~kV~cm-1 in pure BNT to {$\sim$}23~kV~cm-1 in BNT--xBT samples, owing to the coexistence of small ferroelectric domains. This facilitated polarization switching, resulting in slim hysteresis loops. The piezoelectric coefficient improved from 50~pC~N-1 of pristine BNT to 120, 158, and 165~pC~N-1 for BNT--xBT with x values of 0.08~wt\%, 0.09~wt\%, and 0.10~wt\%, respectively. This improvement is attributed to changes in the crystal structure and increased domain mobility. These findings highlight the potential of BNT--xBT, obtained via high-energy ball milling, as a promising lead-free piezoelectric material for advanced electromechanical applications.},

  abstract = {The global energy crisis and environmental pollutions caused mainly by the increased consumption of nonrenewable energy sources prompted researchers to explore alternative energy technologies that can harvest energies available in the ambient environment. Mechanical energy is the most ubiquitous ambient energy that can be captured and converted into useful electric power. Piezoelectric transduction is the prominent mechanical energy harvesting mechanism owing to its high electromechanical coupling factor and piezoelectric coefficient compared to electrostatic, electromagnetic, and triboelectric transductions. Thus, piezoelectric energy harvesting has received the utmost interest by the scientific community. Advancements of micro and nanoscale materials and manufacturing processes have enabled the fabrication of piezoelectric generators with favorable features such as enhanced electromechanical coupling factor, piezoelectric coefficient, flexibility, stretch-ability, and integrate-ability for diverse applications. Besides that, miniature devices with lesser power demand are realized in the market with technological developments in the electronics industry. Thus, it is anticipated that in near future, many electronics will be powered by piezoelectric generators. This paper presents a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of piezoelectric energy harvesting. The piezoelectric energy conversion principles are delineated, and the working mechanisms and operational modes of piezoelectric generators are elucidated. Recent researches on the developments of inorganic, organic, composite, and bio-inspired natural piezoelectric materials are reviewed. The applications of piezoelectric energy harvesting at nano, micro, and mesoscale in diverse fields including transportation, structures, aerial applications, in water applications, smart systems, microfluidics, biomedicals, wearable and implantable electronics, and tissue regeneration are reviewed. The advancements, limitations, and potential improvements of the materials and applications of the piezoelectric energy harvesting technology are discussed. Briefly, this review presents the broad spectrum of piezoelectric materials for clean power supply to wireless electronics in diverse fields.},

Innovative approaches closely mimicking the human bone microenvironment are paramount for advancing bone tissue regeneration. This study leverages a sacrificial template methodology to develop hierarchical 3D porous gelatin-NaNbO3@PDMS scaffolds with gyroid structures mimicking cancellous bone architecture, tailored for enhanced stimuli-responsive biological performance. Modulating porosity levels ({$\sim$}0\%, 18~\%, and 63~\%) enables macro-to-micro pore transitions, highlighting how porosity and zero-curvature surfaces impact critical properties for bioactive scaffold applications. Under simulated physical activity pressures, lower scaffold porosity enhances structural integrity, mechanical stability, and damping capacity, driven by reduced thickness plastic deformation. Corona discharge poling generates electrically charged stimuli-responsive scaffolds, enhancing electric field intensity through charge trapping. Combined with ultrasound stimulation (50 and 250~mW{$\cdot$}cm-2), it boosts metabolic activity, gene expression, and mineralization, increasing calcium deposition by up to 1200~\% compared to unstimulated controls. Finite element analysis reveals that the 63~\% porosity scaffolds generate a sixfold stronger electric field than its 18~\% counterpart, enhancing stimuli-responsive cell alignment, with ultrasound stimulation boosting it by~{$\sim$}10~\%.

  abstract = {Bone implants fabricated using nanocomposites containing hydroxyapatite (HA) and barium titanate (BT) show osteoconductive, osteoinductive, osteointegration, and piezoelectricity properties for bone regeneration applications. In our present study, HA and BT nanopowders were synthesized using high-energy ball-milling-assisted solid-state reaction with precursors of calcium carbonate and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, and barium carbonate and titanium oxide powder mixtures, respectively. Hexagonal HA and tetragonal BT phases were formed after calcination at 700 and 1000 {$^\circ$}C, respectively. Subsequently, hydroxyapatite/barium titanate (HA/BT) nanocomposites with different weight percentages of HA and BT were prepared by ball-milling, then compacted and sintered at two different temperatures to endow these bioceramics with better mechanical, dielectric, and biological properties for bone regeneration. Microstructure, crystal phases, and molecular structure characterizations of these sintered HA/BT nanocomposite compacts (SHBNCs) were performed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, respectively. Bulk density was evaluated using the Archimedes method. HA/BT nanocomposites with increased BT content showed enhanced dielectric properties, and the dielectric constant ({$\epsilon$}r) value for 5HA/95BT was {$\sim$}182 at 100 Hz. Mechanical properties such as Vicker's hardness, fracture toughness, yield strength, and diametral tensile strength were also investigated. The hemolysis assay of SHBNCs exhibited hemocompatibility. The effect of these SHBNCs as implants on thein vitrocytocompatibility and cell viability of MG-63 osteoblast-like cells was assessed by MTT assay and live/dead staining, respectively. 15HA/85BT showed increased metabolic activity with a higher number of live cells than BT after the culture period.

  abstract = {, Novel tissue regeneration strategies are constantly being developed worldwide. Research on bone regeneration is noteworthy, as many promising new approaches have been documented with novel strategies currently under investigation. Innovative biomaterials that allow the coordinated and well-controlled repair of bone fractures and bone loss are being designed to reduce the need for autologous or allogeneic bone grafts eventually. The current engineering technologies permit the construction of synthetic, complex, biomimetic biomaterials with properties nearly as good as those of natural bone with good biocompatibility. To ensure that all these requirements meet, bioactive molecules are coupled to structural scaffolding constituents to form a final product with the desired physical, chemical, and biological properties. Bioactive molecules that have been used to promote bone regeneration include protein growth factors, peptides, amino acids, hormones, lipids, and flavonoids. Various strategies have been adapted to investigate the coupling of bioactive molecules with scaffolding materials to sustain activity and allow controlled release. The current manuscript is a thorough survey of the strategies that have been exploited for the delivery of biomolecules for bone regeneration purposes, from choosing the bioactive molecule to selecting the optimal strategy to synthesize the scaffold and assessing the advantages and disadvantages of various delivery strategies.},

  abstract = {Physiological electric potential is well-known for its indispensable role in maintaining bone volume and quality. Although implanted biomaterials simulating structural, morphological, mechanical, and chemical properties of natural tissue or organ has been introduced in the field of bone regeneration, the concept of restoring physiological electric microenvironment remains ignored in biomaterials design. In this work, a flexible nanocomposite membrane mimicking the endogenous electric potential is fabricated to explore its bone defect repair efficiency. BaTiO3 nanoparticles (BTO NPs) were first coated with polydopamine. Then the composite membranes are fabricated with homogeneous distribution of Dopa@BTO NPs in poly(vinylidene fluoridetrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) matrix. The surface potential of the nanocomposite membranes could be tuned up to -76.8 mV by optimizing the composition ratio and corona poling treatment, which conform to the level of endogenous biopotential. Remarkably, the surface potential of polarized nanocomposite membranes exhibited a dramatic stability with more than half of original surface potential remained up to 12 weeks in the condition of bone defect. In vitro, the membranes encouraged bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) activity and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo, the membranes sustainably maintained the electric microenvironment giving rise to rapid bone regeneration and complete mature bone-structure formation. Our findings evidence that physiological electric potential repair should be paid sufficient attention in biomaterials design, and this concept might provide an innovative and well-suited strategy for bone regenerative therapies.},

  abstract = {The piezoelectric nature of natural bone tissue makes the use of piezoelectric biomaterials in promoting bone regeneration to be a feasible and attractive strategy. Barium titanate (BaTiO3) is well-known for its high piezoelectricity and widely studied as bone repairing bioceramic, but its lacking of bioactive ions may compromise its contribution to osteogenesis. Calcium is the richest metallic element in bone mineral, and manganese is an important doping element for hydroxyapatite, therein, Ca2+ and Mn4+ were individually or co-doped into BaTiO3 nanofibers via sol-gel/electrospinning/calcination technique in this study. Compared to pure BaTiO3 nanofibers, though the piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of Ca2+ and/or Mn4+-doped BaTiO3 nanofibers decreased with increase in ion doping amount, it could maintain approx. 0.9--3.7~pC/N and comparable to that of native bone (0.7--2.3~pC/N) at an optimized content. Under the synergistic effect of the released bioactive ions and the material piezoelectricity, the BaTiO3 nanofibers co-doped with Mn4+ (2~mol\%) and Ca2+ (10~mol\%) (i.e., the sample 2Mn10Ca-BT) achieved the strongest capacity in enhancing the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs), while showing no cytotoxicity. In summary, bioactive ions-doped BaTiO3 nanofibers are promising scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, thanks to their acceptable biocompatibility, appropriate piezoelectricity, and improved osteogenic activity.},
